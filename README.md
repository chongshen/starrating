Custom Control in Dynamics 365 for Web Forms: Star Rating - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery


Star rating is available in Dynamics 365 for mobile, but not for web. Although an option set will provide the same functionality, but it's never as convenient and friendly as a star rating. Also there's a known issue for Dynamics CRM/365 user interface - the option sets are just too small.
I made this simple custom HTML web resource for a 5-star rating on web form. It converts an option set value into numbers of stars, and also updates the option set value on click of the stars. However, to use this web resource, you still need to create an option set, although it will not be visible.
Download link will be provided soon. Star rating CSS inspired by James Barnett.
Hope this makes your CRM forms more friendly.
